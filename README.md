# Pendulum_in_real_world
We usually study about the motion of a pendulum in a very idealistic way , no resistance, amplitude restrictions and so on. Part of the reason is it is really hard to solve the differential equation if we let a sine term be(it is the reason for which we approximate sin(x) as x in high school physics classes), and the job (of finding an analytical solution) becomes impossible if we consider a damping factor as well. So our only hope is to predict the evolution of motion from initial conditions using computers. This program let us turn all the knobs on initial conditions, damping factors, value of g, etc. And let us play around with different scenarios that would evolve in real life when we 'let a pendulum go' !
